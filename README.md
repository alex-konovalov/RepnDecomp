This project aims to investigate and record algorithmic details and to
produce a program (using GAP and/or Sagemath) for computing the
decomposition of a representation œÅ, of a finite group G over the
complex numbers into irreducibles, as well as the corresponding
decomposition of the centraliser of R.  Currently, while methods for
doing this are known (cf.  Serre's book "Linear Representations of
Finite Groups"), there are no open-source computer programs that
implements these methods, nor details on how to achieve good
performance of such an implementation are published.

This program will be useful in, for example, semidefinite programming
and optimisation/feasibility problems involving coding theory, graph
theory, algebraic geometry, combinatorics and more (see
https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2905 for more examples of possible
applications). Specifically, it allows to achieve substantial
reductions in the dimension of these problems; potentially known
results, e.g. on upper bounds on sizes of nonlinear codes, could be
improved with the help of the program.
