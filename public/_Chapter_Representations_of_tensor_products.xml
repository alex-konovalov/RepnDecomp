<Heading>Space-efficient representation of tensors of matrices</Heading>

Suppose we have representations of <Math>G</Math>, <Math>\rho</Math> and <Math>\tau</Math>, with
degree <Math>n</Math> and <Math>m</Math>. If we would like to construct the tensor
product representation of <Math>G</Math>, <Math>\rho \otimes \tau</Math>, the usual way
to do it would be to take the Kronecker product of the
matrices. This means we now have to store very large <Math>nm \times nm</Math>
matrices for each generator of <Math>G</Math>.
This can be avoided by storing the tensor of matrices as pairs,
essentially storing <Math>A \otimes B</Math> as a pair <Math>(A,B)</Math> and
implementing group operations on top of these, along with some
representation-theoretic functions.
Even though matrices do form a ring, it is only possible to
guarantee an economical representation for pure tensors,
i.e. matrices of the form <Math>A \otimes B</Math>. These are closed under
group operations, so it is natural to define a group structure.

Position <Math>i</Math> in this representation stores the matrix <Math>A_i</Math> in the
tensor product <Math>A_1 \otimes A_2</Math>.

Position 1 stores the full Kronecker product of the matrices, this
is very space inefficient and supposed to be used as a last resort.
