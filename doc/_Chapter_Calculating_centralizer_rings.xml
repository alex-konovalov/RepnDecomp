<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="rho" Name="RepresentationCentralizerBlocks" />
 <Returns>List of standard generators (as a vector space) for the centralizer ring of <Math>\rho(G)</Math>, written in the basis given by <Ref Attr="BlockDiagonalBasis" />. The matrices are given as a list of blocks.
</Returns>
 <Description>
Let <Math>G</Math> have irreducible representations <Math>\rho_i</Math> with
multiplicities <Math>m_i</Math>. The centralizer has dimension <Math>\sum_i m_i^2</Math>
as a <Math>\mathbb{C}</Math>-vector space. This function gives the minimal
number of generators required.

  <Func Arg="rho" Name="RepresentationCentralizer" />
 <Returns>List of standard generators (as a vector space) for the centralizer ring of <Math>\rho(G)</Math>.
</Returns>
 <Description>
This gives the same result as <Ref
Func="RepresentationCentralizerBlocks" />, but with the matrices
given in their entirety: not as lists of blocks, but as full
matrices.

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="rho" Name="RepresentationCentralizerDecomposed" />
 <Returns>List of generators (as a vector space) for the centralizer ring of <Math>\rho(G)</Math>, under the map taking each identity matrix block to a 1 by 1 block.
</Returns>
 <Description>
This function is here to demonstrate the reduction in
dimension of the centralizer <Math>C</Math> by writing it in the basis given
by <Ref Attr="BlockDiagonalBasis" />. The matrices given are as
reduced as possible.
